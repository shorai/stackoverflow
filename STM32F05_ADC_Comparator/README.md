STM32L05 Using Comparator and ADC simultaneously on the same pin
================================================================

Please see the results.txt in this directory for a short description of the results I got when testing a Nucleo board.

Also please look at

Where the initial discussion on this topic took place.

The code colud be cleaned a bit.... but you can get the idea of most of it from main.c

The initial code was generated by STM_cube software. This software isunable to configure this usage, you have to play with the comparator initialization registers.

I also did not get the COMP2 working with ADC channel 1. This is probably something silly my end
